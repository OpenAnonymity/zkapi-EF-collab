//! Swappable authentication / credential schemes for zkAPI.
//!
//! The daemons run with one of two interchangeable authentication methods,
//! selected by configuration:
//!
//! - [`AuthSchemeKind::StateAnchor`] — the reference state-anchor chain: a
//!   Pedersen balance commitment anchored by a nullifier chain and signed
//!   forward with XMSS (delegates to the `protocol` crypto module).
//! - [`AuthSchemeKind::BlindSignature`] — blind Schnorr credentials issued by
//!   the server, presented unlinkably per request.
//!
//! [`CredentialScheme`] is the thin interface both implement. It covers the
//! five operations the daemons need:
//!
//! 1. how the client builds the per-request presentation ([`CredentialScheme::authenticate`]),
//! 2. how the server verifies it ([`CredentialScheme::verify`]),
//! 3. how spend tokens are derived (returned by `authenticate` / `verify`),
//! 4. how the next state is computed after a charge ([`CredentialScheme::apply_charge`]),
//! 5. how withdrawal authorizations are built ([`CredentialScheme::build_withdrawal`]).
//!
//! The reference (in-process) implementations hold both client and server
//! state so the whole flow is unit-testable end to end; the daemons wire the
//! same operations across the HTTP boundary.
